# PolyFS

PolyFS is a work-in-progress design concept for a distributed filesystem written in Rust. We are currently prototyping the design specification in this [document](https://github.com/katharostech/PolyFS/blob/master/doc/polyfs-design-paper/paper.pdf).

The current Rust code in the repository is from a previous prototype and is going to be completely rewritten.
